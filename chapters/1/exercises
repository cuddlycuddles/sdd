1. The object file does not look like the source file, as it is compiled to be understandable for the machine.

2. The program: 
- prompts the user for a radius
- scans the user input and stores it into the radius variable.
- calculates the area of a circle based on the radius the user specified
- outputs the area of the circle (only to integer precision)

3. The program:
- uses a for loop that uses a nested for loop to print out 10 x's, then prints out a newline character
- the outer for loop is executed 10 times
- 10 rows of 10 x's are outputted

4. Line 3 generates an error message, because a semi-colon took the place of the opening curly brace 
for the int main (void) function

5. Line 6 generates an error message, because it called the do_it function, which was never declared 
and did not exist within the program

6. The program now prints out 10 empty rows, because the format character inside the double quotation marks 
specified a single character, but the additional argument provided to the printf statement was the
number 1, which is not a character, but an integer. However, the program would've printed out 10 rows
of 10 one's if the one was enclosed by single quotation marks, as it would be a string in that case, 
OR if the format character inside the double quotation marks was "%i", as it would expect an integer
