1. Why C is the best choice for a programming language:
- It is a language of few words, making it easier to understand but still capable of performing any programs.
- It is modular and C code can be written in routines that can be reused
- It is popular, powerful and flexible

2. The compiler compiles the source code and makes it understandable for the computer, in binary

3. Steps in the Program Development Cycle:
- Determine objectives
- Determine methods you want to use in the program
- Create the program to accomplish objectives and fulfil requirements
- Run program to see results

4. To compile a program called program1.c, you need to enter program1

5. Although compiling and linking are mentioned as two separate steps, compilers usually do both as one step.

6. The extension you should have for your C source files is .c

7. FILENAME.TXT is not a valid name for a C source file

8. If you executed a program that you compiled and it doesn't work as you expected, you should fix any errors in the source
code

9. Machine language is the sequence of 0's and 1's that computers can understand, use and act upon

10. The linker combines the object code produced when your source code was compiled with the boject code from the function
library to create the final executable program. It allows the use of predefined functions such as printf()
